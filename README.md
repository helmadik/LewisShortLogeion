LewisShort from Perseus, edited at Chicago; needs your help! 

This Lewis and Short copy could be much more helpful to its users, especially by making the references to the primary texts work. 
Feel free to dig in! As for other typos, etcetera, I don't think this copy is very much different from the Perseus Tufts copy, 
but some editing has been done over the years. 

These files have now seen a major round of editing. Many thanks to Josh Dillon for modernizing all the Terence citations!

Easter egg: find the correct citations where there is a 'not found' comment:-) Volunteers to deal with fragmentary authors and other infelicities still very much welcome. 

Added Feb. 2021, Authors & Works abbreviations in a txt file.
