# LewisShortLogeion
LewisShort from Perseus, edited at Chicago; needs your help! 

This Lewis and Short copy could be much more helpful to its users, especially by making the references to the primary texts work. 
Feel free to dig in! As for other typos, etcetera, I don't think this copy is very much different from the Perseus Tufts copy, 
but some editing has been done over the years. 

These files have now seen a major round of editing. Many thanks to Josh Dillon for modernizing all the Terence citations!

Easter egg: find the correct citations where there is a 'not found' comment:-) Volunteers to deal with fragmentary authors and other infelicities still very much welcome. 

Added Feb. 2021, Authors & Works abbreviations in a txt file. 

April 2023, a milestone: Thanks to Paul McKenna, Gabi Garcia, and Kasey Corra, Plautus citations now have line numbers instead of act-scene-line notations.

Because texts evolve, and there could still be errors in the references, the human-readable references still include the act-scene-line notation as well. 
NOTE: Due to using Python xml libraries, there has been some XML normalization. I hope this does not mean trouble for any user. Just in case, the most recent version can be found in a separate repo: LewisShortLogeion_pre_Plautus..
